|		Question 5 - Coverage Score 		|
|							|
|_______________________________________________________|


I attempted to increase the Coverage score up to 100%, however due to the time remaining I unfortunately could not achieve this. 
The setup issues and additional related errors that came after made me lose a lot of time, and therefore was not able to fully complete this exercise.

---- Coverage Score ------------------ 

- Final Coverage Score achieved is 43,7 %

----- Analysis of difference between Instruction and Branch Coverage------------

Before answering how we can ensure 100% coverage score on both Instruction and Branch tests, we need to define each one. 
Instruction coverage, otherwise called Line coverage, is the amount of lines that are executed by the tests.
On the other hand, Branch coverage score is defined as the amount of different code blocks/branches that have been executed.
For example a switch or if statement can be considered a block of code that contains branches (each condition is each own code branch).

So how can we ensure 100% on both Instruction and Branch Coverage? We could argue that if we achieve 100% Branch coverage, we have covered every code block/branch and thus also every instruction. 
However, achieving 100% Instruction coverage does not imply 100% Branch coverage, simply because executing all lines of code does not necessarily mean that we have covered every possible branch.
For example, an if-statement or switch might contain multiple branches due to its conditions, which might not be covered even if all lines contained in the statements are executed at least one.
Therefore to answer the question, achieving 100% branch coverage implies that we have achieved 100% line coverage.
